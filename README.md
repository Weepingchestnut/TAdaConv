# pytorch-video-understanding
This codebase will provide a comprehensive video understanding solution, including state-of-the-art video models (both convolutional and transformer-based), self-supervised video representation learning approaches and temporal action detection methods, etc.

Works to be released soon:
- [Self-supervised Motion Learning from Static Images](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Huang_Self-Supervised_Motion_Learning_From_Static_Images_CVPR_2021_paper).
- [Towards Training Stronger Video Vision Transformers for EPIC-KITCHENS-100 Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05058)
- [A Stronger Baseline for Ego-Centric Action Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06942)

Other standard models and approaches for learning representations in videos will also be included. 
Stay tuned!
